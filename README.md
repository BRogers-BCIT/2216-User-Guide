## Outline

### &emsp;Introduction

Welcome to our guide on connecting your JetBrains IDE to your GitHub account and repositories. The goal of this guide is to help new developers quickly and easily connect to GitHub when learning to use a new IDE. This process can be confusing for those who are new to using GitHub or Jet Brains IDE's. Our goal is to explain the process step-by-step to help you get started as soon as possible .

### &emsp;Guide Topics

This guide aims to help you get off the ground and start developing your projects. It will cover three important elements for implementing version control on your projects.

1. Connecting your GitHub account to your IDE.
2. Pushing an existing project to a GitHub repository.
3. Connecting to a GitHub project inside your IDE.

### &emsp;Guide Elements

In addition, this guide contains several elements to enable a smooth learning process.

* Overview: Everything you will need to get started with this guide. Includes a list of what you will need to get started and an example of the of how to read the guide's instructions. It also provides a detailed explanation of each section of the guide.
* Trouble Shooting: An index of common issues and step-by-step instructions about how to fix them.
* Glossary: Contains an in-depth explanation of the words and phrases used within this guide.

## Development

### &emsp;Planning and Ideation

We created this guide to help new developers learn to implement GitHub into their IDE's. From this goal we brainstormed all the tasks a user would be likely to want to use GitHub for. We then decided to focus on the first three tasks that a user is likely to encounter while learning. This allowed us to create a user guide focused on helping new developers. We hope that it helps developers start to take advantage of the version control tools in their IDE.

### &emsp;Style Guide

We started by outlining a series of rules to follow while writing. These rules helped ensure we created simple and easy to follow instructions.

* Start instructions with an action (verb).
* Follow the action with an explanation of what it will accomplish.
* Instruction steps should be accompanied with an image related to the action.
* All instruction steps should be followed by a success step.
* The success step should describe what a successful outcome looks like.
* The success step should also show a visual of what the successful outcome looks like.
* Include alert and error messages to inform the user of important information.
* Success and instruction steps are numbered, alert and error messages are not.

The goal of these rules was to ensure the guide was always clear, concise, and consistent. Writing all instructions, the same way minimizes confusion for users moving between instructions.

Including visuals with each instruction makes it clear what the user should do for that step. Inserting an expected outcome image after each step shows users what they should currently be seeing. These rules help prevent confusion for users who are reading the guide.

### &emsp;Rough Draft

We started creating the user guide by making a rough draft of outline and task instructions. This allowed us to refine our writing while focusing on clarity and conciseness. Once we finished the writing elements we moved on to the visual instructions. We acquired the necessary screenshots and added highlights to relevant information. With the outline and instructions complete, we created the glossary and troubleshooting sections. We organized the definitions of the technical terms into a reference table. Finally, we organized all the common issues and fixes into the troubleshooting section.

### &emsp;Final Copy

Once we created the rough draft, we had the component elements of the guide finished. The final step in creating the guide was to assemble the parts that we had created. We used markdown language in Mk Docs to create the final visual presentation of the guide. Using a standardized formatting method let us create a consistent layout across the guide. We then used the tools available in Mk Docs to create a pleasant and professional visual style. In the end we created a simple user guide to help new developers get started with GitHub and Jet Brains IDE's.

## Tools

### &emsp;VS Code

We developed and tested the guides visual elements using VS Code. We used virtual environment to simulate our markdown code while developing it. This made it easy to test changes and view the results. The fast feedback cycle allowed for quick development of the guide's visual elements.

### &emsp;Markdown

The development of this user guide was done using markdown language. It was the first time we have used markdown extensively and was a great learning opportunity. The easy-to-understand language and clear documentation made it easy to learn . It also helped maintain consistency while group members worked on separate items. This was a great chance to practice a skill we will use often in our future. Mk Docs

We developed the visual design of the guide through Mk Docs. Access to a professional visual style made it easy to develop a visually appealing guide. It was a useful tool for creating documentation and one we will continue to use in the future.

### &emsp;JetBrains IDE

The JetBrains line of IDE's was the reason for the guides creation. While IDE's are an excellent tool for developers, the number of options can be overwhelming. This results in many useful functions being confusing or hard to find. This issue is particularly apparent when working with version control. However, the use of version control is a vital tool for modern software development. Helping new developers use this feature is the reason we created this guide.

## Reflection

### &emsp;User Guide

We decided to create this guide while discussing what we struggled with as new developers. We discovered that learning to use GitHub through an IDE had been a long process for both of us. We realized that it could have been much easier if it was clearly explained to us at the start. We created this guide to help new developers get started with GitHub. Our goal is to make the process quick and easy with step-by-step instructions.

### &emsp;Project Development

The creation of this user guide was an excellent chance to practice writing for the user. It helped us to focus on accounting for the differences in our knowledge and experience. It also helped us to examine how we explained concepts and let us break them down into their most basic steps. Developing this project was an excellent chance to practice and refine these skills.

### &emsp;Outcome

Creating this guide has been a great chance to practice writing content for users. The skills we developed while creating this guide will be essential for our future in computer science. We also developed a guide we are proud of and hope that it can help future developers.

Thank you for your interest in the development of our guide to GitHub and JetBrains IDE's. We hope this guide was useful in learning or helping another to learn the basics of GitHub.
